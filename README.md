# European-Football-Leagues-Analysis

In this project, I did analysis on FIFA 22 dataset from [kaagle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juniorverli/fifa-22-all-normal-players-from-ultimate-team?select=all_players.csv) website. The goal is to predict best player for each position and best possible squad player for Top Five European Leagues(Premier League, LaLiga Santander, Bundesliga, Serie A TIM, and Ligue 1 Uber Eats).
